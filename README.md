# context-builder
builds a pds4 context_area xml doc for data generation testing purposes

in order to run it, run "python inputgenerator.py" and then follow the prompt

it will generate intermediate files as well as context area xml files.

There is a bash script clean.sh (that I may forget to include) that should remove all of the generated files.
